/*
A company made a very large banner with a string S printed on it. The string  is formed by 
lowercase English alphabets. They wanted that in the string S, after k characters, the 
pattern printed should repeat i.e. suppose that S=herohero and k=4 then you see that after 4 characters, 
again the word  starts.

By mistake, the string S did not follow this order. Now, you are given the task to correct
 the string S so that after every k characters the string begins to repeat. To change a 
 character into another character the cost involved is the absolute difference between 
 the positions of characters in the sequence of English alphabets. For e.g. if you want 
to change e to a or a to e then the cost is 5 - 1 = 4.

Input

The first line contains a string  as input.
The second line of input contains an integer .

Output

In the output, you need to print the minimum cost to convert the string  to a string which repeats itself after each interval of size .
